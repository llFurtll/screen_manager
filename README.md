## Why?
The initiative to create this plugin was because I didn't like the way we create components in <b>Flutter</b>.
<br><br>
Every time we create a separate file to put all the business rules of a certain component it was usually necessary to pass functions by parameters for that component to perform the necessary action in our screen, so I thought of a way to manage components in our project, where all of them will follow a pattern defined in the <b>Compmanager</b>, thus facilitating the communication between the component and the screen.
<br><br>
The main focus of the <b>Compmanager</b> is basically to create components for a certain screen and have access to the necessary attributes within the screen to make the changes you want. Of course, a particular component that is generally reusable can also be created using <b>Compmanager</b>.

## How to use?
Well, in addition to the example project that is here in the repository I will create one more basic example for you to see what idea I propose.
<br><br>
But first I want to explain that the creation of the <b>Compmanager</b> was also thought a little using <b>Object Orientation</b>.
Well, as an example, I will recreate the famous count screen that comes in the standard Flutter documentation using <b>Compmanager</b>.
<br><br>
After that we will configure pubspec.yaml by adding the Compmanager dependency.

<br><br>
Now in main.dart we will create the classes needed to create our counter.
<br><br>
Basically every screen that you want to use components of must implement the abstract class IScreen, in which case you will be asked to override the methods emitScreen and receive.
<br>

<br><br>
In this example we will actually use the StatelessWidget and you may notice that it is implementing IScreen. The emitScreen method is used by the component, basically when the component wants to perform some action on the screen it will call this method, and as you can notice this method takes an IComponent as an argument, so you can tell which component the event is being emitted from, by default when emitScreen is called then our screen automatically calls the event from the component.
<br><br>
The receive method is basically used so that this screen itself can be called on other screens, and by this method you will be able to pass what message, for example a delete or update action, pass a dynamic value, a String or an int among others and even identify from which screen that call was made.
<br><br>
You can notice that as we used a private attribute on the screen, we created a getNotifier for our components to use this method to have access to this attribute and change.

## Creating the component
Now we are going to create our component, so create a new file with the name you want and use the following code.
<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48370450/167038227-aa234164-0b27-48ab-99ca-913caba54f40.png)
<br><br>
It is important to understand that as we need to make changes to the screen, we will pass the same via the constructor.
<br><br>
In the component you can notice that it implements the IComponent, at this moment it is passed which screen you will use this component, in case you are going to use it in several screens you can pass AnyScreen, after it is placed the Widget type that it will be used and in the last one the return type of the methods. For example, if by chance you want an action on your screen to have a Dialog first indicating if it wants to do a certain action, you can pass a Future instead of void, so all methods will be returned as Future.
<br><br>
We also have the init method, this method is for initializing properties of the component if it has them, use it in the constructor if you need to. <br>
The afterEvent and beforeEvent methods are basically used to perform actions before and after the event, in case you need to implement your rule in these methods and call them together in the event method, this way you can perform an action before and after the change on the screen.
<br><br>
If you are not going to use any of the methods, just create a reusable component on the screens without changing any information, just pass void and leave the methods with return.

## Calling the component on the screen.
Since we are using the StatelessWidget we will instantiate the component directly in the constructor, if you are using the StatefulWidget you can do this in the initState method.
<br>

<br><br>
After creating the instance of the component we will call it in Scaffold.
<br>

<br><br>
When you run the project you will see that the counter is running correctly.
<br>

## Conversable class
The Conversable class is used to send information from one screen to another, for example a button on one screen will update something on another screen, so using this class you will be able to do it, let's go to a basic example.
<br><br>
Following our project, let's create a second screen where it will have a button that, when clicked, will call the main screen asking it to increase the count, let's go.
<br><br>
First let's create the second screen.
<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48370450/167047362-22974c5a-02fd-427c-a912-776b45e33006.png)
<br><br>
Creation of the button to go to the second screen.

<br><br>
Now we need to add our screen in Conversable to indicate that this screen can be called from elsewhere in the project.
<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48370450/167047773-c86a1baa-e508-4c96-9db1-d1a71a9d147a.png)
<br><br>
Basically we instantiate our Conversable and add the screen by the constructor, if it is a Stateful use the initState method. Thus, we pass the screen identification, in the case of the "main" example, and the reference of the screen itself.
<br><br>
Now, on the second screen, we will program the button to send the request to main when clicked.

<br><br>
As you can see we instantiate our Conversable class, in onPressed we call the callScreen method passing the identifier and in that we call the screen's receive method and then we go back to the initial screen.
<br><br>
Finally, let's implement the receive method of the splash screen.
<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48370450/167048228-6b4bccd7-13c5-4f34-a742-95920653c6c0.png)
<br><br>
We use a switch to identify which type of message, if it is an increment we add to our variable. The third argument if you want to use it is to identify which screen made the call.
<br><br>
Remember to hot restart the project
